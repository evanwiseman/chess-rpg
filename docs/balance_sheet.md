## Piece Stats

| Piece   | HP  | Damage | Notes                                    |
|---------|-----|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Pawn    | 10  | 5      | Weak but expendable                      |
| Knight  | 30  | 15     | Solid skirmisher                         |
| Bishop  | 30  | 15     | Same as knight, more positional          |
| Rook    | 50  | 25     | Tanky, heavy hitter                      |
| Queen   | 90  | 45     | Powerhouse, centerpiece                  |
| King    | 80  | 10     | Must be protected, clears pawns easily   |

## Design Notes

- **Fast-paced battles**: Pawns die in 2 hits, stronger units in a handful of exchanges.  
- **Attrition gameplay**: Pieces wear each other down rather than instant captures.  
- **King’s role**: Defensive, not offensive — good at killing pawns, weak against strong units.  
- **Iteration**: Numbers are flexible; adjust after playtesting for pacing or balance.
